## Narrative

### Setting

More than 3,000 years have passed since humanity abandoned its homeworld. A civil war erased not only Earth’s habitability, but also its location from recorded memory. Scattered across asteroids, space stations, and foreign worlds, humanity has survived—but lost its identity.

In the year 5006, deep-space archives reveal a potential match. Beneath a red sun lies a scarred planet—possibly Earth. A crew of Returners is dispatched to investigate and reclaim what was lost.

The surface is hostile: oceans have receded, air is toxic, and the skies are torn by constant lightning. Amid the ruins of forgotten cities, relics wait—alongside guardians of ancient ages, risen from humanity’s darkest history.

## Purpose

Re-Earthed is being developed as a final project for a school course in game development. The focus is on building core systems in Unity, procedural logic, and integrating narrative and gameplay in a cohesive design.
